 # Regression-Toolkit
Computes summary statistics, creates simple and multiple linear regression models using linear algebra, and visualizes models in Python.

This project may be used for modeling and visualizing data via 
simple or multiple regression without the need for purchasing software subscriptions
like those of JMP or SPSS. It allows the user to compute basic summary statistics 
like the mean, median, standard deviation, correlation, compute regression models with an 
unbounded number of explanatory variables, and visualize said regression models at will.

 # Regression-Toolkit
Computes summary statistics, creates simple and multiple linear regression models using linear algebra, and visualizes models in Python.

The intent of this project from the standpoint of the developer is to learn more about
Python, data science, and applications of linear algebra. From a user or business 
standpoint, this project is extremely useful for modeling and visualizing data via 
simple or multiple regression without the need for purchasing expensive software subscriptions
like those of JMP or SPSS. This project allows the user to compute basic summary statistics 
like the mean, median, standard deviation, correlation, compute regression models with an 
unbounded number of explanatory variables, and visualize said regression models at will.
